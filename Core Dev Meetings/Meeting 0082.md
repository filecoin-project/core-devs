**August 7, 2025**

## Welcome Michael Madoff - New Head of Governance

Michael joined from the Cardano ecosystem, where he spent 3.5 years rolling out their governance system. His background includes strategy consulting at Boston Consulting Group and political science research.

**Priorities for Filecoin governance**
- **Operational excellence** â€” make processes more transparent and efficient  
- **Economic alignment** â€” keep the economic model secure and properly incentivized  
- **Community-centered governance** â€” give all stakeholders a real voice

## FIP Cleanup Progress

Weâ€™ve made serious headway on the FIP backlog â€” from **23** draft FIPs down to **4**. Most were straightforward status updates; for several, we reached out to authors on whether to keep pushing forward.

A few were rejected based on author feedback. Everything is documented on GitHub (source of truth for FIP statuses).

**`FIP-0064` needs discussion** â€” it proposes tweaks to the base fee mechanism. The author will present at the next meeting to address implementation complexity and potential attack vectors.

## NV27 Network Upgrade Planning

**Context:**  
This table summarizes the revised **Network Upgrade (NV27) FIPs queue** discussed during **Core Devs Meeting 82**.  
It reflects the latest status, timeline considerations, and prioritization of proposals based on Core Devs 82 discussions.  

**Tentative Timeline:**  
The NV27 upgrade planning starts with a **target code freeze date of August 31, 2025**.

## FIP100 Monitoring Committee Update

The committee is active with a dedicated Slack channel. Theyâ€™re building a dashboard to track FIP100 effects (sector onboarding, economics, fee burn).

Goal: monitor for a few months, then hand over to the community for ongoing tracking. **Charter ETA: end of week.**

## Next Steps

- [ ] `FIP-0064` author presentation at next Core Devs  
- [ ] Two-week community feedback window on NV27 plan  
- [ ] Publish FIP100 committee charter  
- [ ] Continue pushing `FIP-0109` through editor review  

*The upgrade timeline is tight but achievable with the current scope. Weâ€™re prioritizing correctness over cramming in features.*
