## FIPs included

This is a lightweight network upgrade that does not change actors version. It is used as a signal for the FIP-0100 implementation to end the grace period for application of fees to legacy sectors.

See [FIP-0100: Removing Batch Balancer, Replacing It With a Per-sector Fee and Removing Gas-limited Constraints](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0100.md).

## Actors version

This network version uses built-in actors v16.0.0, available in the release branch: [release/v15](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/tree/release/v16).

Note that this is the same actors version as v25.
