Here is most of the [diff from v11](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/compare/release/v11...release/v12).
This comparison is incomplete because the [release/v11](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/commits/release/v11) branch reverted two significant changes after the branch point.
